      The site has good proximity. Related UI items like the comic title with thumbnail and the author info area with descriptions are all grouped together. Making it easier to see what relates to what.

      <dt>Recommendation to Improve the Website</dt>
      <dd>
        The accessibility elements for people who may have disabilities needs work. These were most of the errors I saw the page flagged for when I ran it through the checker. The website had 42 elements that needs fixing when it comes to ensuring the contrast between the foreground and background colors meets WCAG AA minimum contrast ratio thresholds.
