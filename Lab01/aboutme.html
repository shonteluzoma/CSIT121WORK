            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                19 year old with a passion for fashion. Just kidding. Fashion is cool but that was a reference to the show "Bratz" which was a favorite of mine growing up. I was obesessed with anything Bratz related. Now I'm obsessed with anime, vivienne westwood, God, and my pinterest page with over 27k monthly views *winks*.

                I can sing a little bit, I'm good at impressions of people I know, and I love reading. (Right now I'm reading "Sunrise on the Reaping" by Suzanne Collins.)
