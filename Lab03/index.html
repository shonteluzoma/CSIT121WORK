<p>Welcome to my webpage! At first this task seemed like a lot <br> but once you start to get in the groove of things it's really not that bad. <br> Having the basic understanding of how to structure HTML is important <br> in teaching you how webpages are built. Once you know your tags and <br>structures and work on your precision while typing to avoid errors, it should <br> be smooth sailing from there. </p>
<h3>What I Learned...</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Attention to detail is key, always check for errors and typos.</li>
    <li>An ancestor refers to any element that is connected but further up the document tree - no matter how many levels higher.</li>
<li>A descendant refers to any element that is connected but lower down the document tree - no matter how many levels lower.</li>

<h2>Lab 3</h2>
<p>Learning about CSS was fun. It really enhances a webpage visually and bring life to the html. I also love how we can link it to our html externally because it makes everything way more organized that way. Overall it's a good way to express your creativity through your website.</p>
<h3>Things that I learned since Lab 02 for Lab 03</h3>
<ol>
    <li>CSS lets you pick which HTML elements to style using selectors.</li>
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
<li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
</ol>
